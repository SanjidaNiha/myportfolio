        To get started, you'll need a ServiceNow account. You can sign up for a free developer instance on the <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/" target="_blank">ServiceNow Developer Portal</a>. This instance will allow you to explore and experiment with ServiceNow features.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Navigating the Interface</strong><br>
        Once logged in, you'll encounter the ServiceNow interface. Familiarize yourself with the following:

        </ul></p>

        <h2>Core Components of ServiceNow</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Tables and Fields</strong><br>
        ServiceNow organizes data into tables. Each table contains records, and each record has various fields. For example, the "Incident" table might include fields like "Short Description," "Priority," and "Status."</p>
        <p><strong>2. Forms and Lists</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forms:</strong> Used to create or edit records. Customize forms to capture necessary information.</li>
            <li><strong>Lists:</strong> Display multiple records in a table format. Use filters to find specific records.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h2>Customizing ServiceNow</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Creating a Custom Application</strong><br>
        ServiceNow allows you to build custom applications tailored to your needs. Here’s a basic overview of how to create a custom application:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Navigate to Studio:</strong> Access the Studio environment from the application navigator.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a New Application:</strong> Click on “Create Application” and follow the prompts to define your application’s name and description.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Tables:</strong> Create custom tables to store data specific to your application.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><strong>2. Adding and Configuring Fields</strong><br>
        Customize your tables by adding new fields. For example, in a “Tour Booking System” application, you might add fields like "Tour Name," "Booking Date," and "Customer."</p>
        <p><strong>3. UI Policies and Actions</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UI Policies:</strong> Control the visibility and behavior of fields based on certain conditions. For instance, you might hide or show fields based on user input.</li>
            <li><strong>UI Actions:</strong> Add buttons or links that perform actions, such as saving a record or sending an email.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Scripting in ServiceNow</strong><br>
        ServiceNow uses JavaScript for scripting. You can write scripts to automate tasks, create custom logic, and interact with the ServiceNow database. Common scripting areas include business rules, client scripts, and script includes.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Integrations with Other Tools</strong><br>
